### **P-Values and Confidence Intervals**

This R script serves as a demonstration of the concepts of p-values and confidence intervals in a computational context. Through a linear regression model predicting internal temperatures based on external temperatures, the script shows the computation of P-values, assessing the likelihood of observed parameter values under the null hypothesis. Additionally, the script demonstrates the estimation of confidence intervals using bootstrapping techniques.

This resource is designed for educational purposes, allowing to explore and comprehend the practical application of these fundamental statistical concepts in a computational context.
